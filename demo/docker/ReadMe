This demo is a possible real-world situation. You want to start a Docker
container that runs a server, but:

* Not if it is already running
  * In that case just quit, with a useful message
* Not if the docker image needs to be built or rebuilt
  * Get the source code if needed
  * Check if image even exists yet
    * If so, check that the Docker file hasn't been changed since build time

This *seems* like normal Makefile stuff, until you realize that `make` can't
make decisions over these kind of conditions... Luckily MakePlus can!
