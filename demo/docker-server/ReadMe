This demo is a possible real-world situation. You want to start a Docker
container that runs a server, but:

* Not if it is already running
  * In that case just quit, with a useful message
* Not if the docker image needs to be built or rebuilt
  * Check if image even exists yet
  * If so, check that the `Dockerfile` hasn't been changed since build time

This *seems* like normal Makefile stuff, until you realize that `make` can't
make decisions over these kind of conditions... Luckily MakePlus can! Just run
`make start`.

The `make stop` command will stop the server, but only if it is running. If it
is running the checker function prints the container id to stdout, and it ends
up in `$<` so the docker stop command works.

The `make test` command calls the server and prints `PASS` or `FAIL`.

The `make clean` command will delete the docker server image, so you can stop
over.
